<h1 id="about-me"></h1>

<h2 style="margin: 80px 0px 10px;"></h2>

I am an incoming Assistant Professor in the [School of Computer Science](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/science-engineering/schools/computer-science/) at the [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/), starting in January 2026. I am also a visiting scientist at the [RIKEN Center for Advanced Intelligence Project (RIKEN-AIP)](https://www.riken.jp/en/research/labs/aip/) and a member of the [European Laboratory for Learning and Intelligent Systems (ELLIS)](https://ellis.eu/).

My research focuses on trustworthy machine learning, spanning the design, analysis, and evaluation of reliable learning algorithms under data corruption, across diverse data modalities, and under real-world constraints. I work on both the theoretical foundations of machine learning and its applications in core AI areas such as computer vision and reinforcement learning, as well as real-world problems in healthcare.

**Research Interests**
- **Weakly Supervised Learning:** Advancing learning paradigms that enable models to perform reliably under imperfect supervision, including but not limited to corrupted labels, distribution shifts, and selection bias.
- **Representation Learning:** Developing principled approaches for learning robust, interpretable and transferable representations that effectively fuse information from diverse data modalities.
- **Machine Learning for Social Good:** Designing responsible models and algorithms that remain effective while supporting fairness, privacy, and broader societal benefit.

Previously, I was a postdoctoral fellow in the [Foundations of Machine Learning Systems Group](https://fm.ls/) at the University of Tübingen, Germany, working with [Prof. Robert Williamson](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=G4MBruQAAAAJ&hl=en). I received my Ph.D. in Machine Learning from the University of Tokyo, Japan, under the supervision of [Prof. Masashi Sugiyama](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=GkYIrlIAAAAJ&hl=en).
